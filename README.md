# CSS-Study Monorepo

This monorepo is designed for learning and experimenting with CSS, SCSS, and frontend component development. It uses the npm workspaces feature to organize reusable packages and demo applications.

## Structure
- `apps/` contains demo applications (e.g., information-box)
- `packages/` contains reusable SCSS themes, utilities, and component libraries

## Usage
- Run scripts from the root to build or start individual projects:
  - `npm run compile:scss-theme` — Compiles SCSS theme package
  - `npm run start:information-box-project` — Starts the information-box demo app

## Technologies
- SCSS (7-1 pattern, BEM methodology)
- Vite (for fast development server)

Feel free to add new packages or apps for your CSS/SCSS studies!
